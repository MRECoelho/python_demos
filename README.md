# Python Demo's
This repo contains two programs, the program visualizer and music folder rebuilder. Both were uploaded as a (working) demo for review.

## Program visualizer
This code was built for a post master student working on a project which was meant to investigate the focus span of senior citizens when using a computer for work purposes. This code essentially logs the programs that are active and which one is focussed. The logs are saved to a database and afterwards it is ready for a visual representation of the users actions. At the moment this code is written specifically for Windows.

## Music folder rebuilder
This code was built to aid with the restoration of a music library. After a program malfunction the folder hierarchy of my collection was destroyed and all music files were deleted. The music files could be recovered but not the inital music file names and the folder hierarchy. However by reading the music files' meta data all lost information could be restored using this code.
